# Version 1.0.8

**Goal**:  Implement the "Add to Cart" functionality to enhance user experience by allowing users to easily add items to their cart and receive confirmation when the order is placed.

## Additional Notes
We didn't need to access the backend for this feature since the items are simply added to the table without requiring additional details from our backend data.
